// Additional query functions can be added here as needed
// These functions would typically interact with a database to perform CRUD operations
// on the Post model. The actual database interaction code is not included here
// as it would depend on the specific database and ORM being used.
// Ensure to handle errors and return appropriate responses in a real application.
// This is a basic structure and should be expanded with actual database logic.
// You might also want to implement pagination, filtering, and sorting in the query functions
// depending on your application's requirements.
// You can also consider using a repository pattern to separate the database logic from the business logic.
// This would help in maintaining a clean architecture and making the code more testable.
// Additionally, consider implementing input validation and error handling in the query functions
// to ensure that the data being processed is valid and to handle any potential errors gracefully.
// You might also want to implement logging in the query functions to track the operations being performed,
// which can be helpful for debugging and monitoring the application.
// Consider using context for passing request-scoped values and deadlines to the query functions,
// especially if you are working with a web application where requests can have timeouts.
// If you are using a specific database, you might want to implement connection pooling
// to manage database connections efficiently and improve performance.
// You can also consider implementing caching for frequently accessed data to improve performance,
// especially if the data does not change frequently. This can significantly reduce the load on the database
// and improve response times for the users.
